# MediaCloudClient

Just a simple Android client for [MediaCloud Server](https://github.com/Ruikuan/MediaCloudServer). It will fetch server's file list, and use another media player to play those video files.

I write it to run on my Skyworth E900 TV box, but other Android device can use it with pleasure, too.

~~This project is just started. It's my first Andriod App, so the develop speed may be very slow.~~  
The app can run now, maybe not too robust, who know? 

## Release

Now a release apk is a available at http://pan.baidu.com/s/1mh7zYfI
